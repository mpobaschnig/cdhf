## Introduction ‚òïÔ∏è

### Dataset Description

Mattermost is an open-source communication platform similar to slack that is widely used at CERN. The CERN Anonymized Mattermost Dataset includes Mattermost data from January 2018 to November 2021 with 20794 CERN  users, 2367 Mattermost teams, 12773 Mattermost channels, 151 CERN buildings, and 163 CERN  organizational units. The data set states the relationship between Mattermost teams, Mattermost channels, and CERN users, and holds various information such as channel creation, channel deletion times, user channel joining and leave times, and user-specific information such as building and organizational units. To hide identifiable information (e.g. Team Name, User Name, Channel Name, etc.), the dataset was anonymized. The anonymization was done by omitting some attributes, hashing string values, and removing connections between users/teams/channels.

## Getting Started üèÅ


### Setup üíª
---

#### 1. Retrieving the Dataset
---
Retrieve Mattermost Data (`mmdata.json`) from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/6319684#.YnOMdi8Rr0o).

#### 2. Install cdhf from pypi
---

Install the cdhf package by

```sh
$ pip install cdhf
```

#### 3. Import and use cdhf
---

Include the cdhf package:

```python
from cdhf.data import Data
```

Create the Data object to and load the data set:

```python
data = Data("path/to/mmdata.json/file")

data.load_all()
```

You can find examples on how to work with the data at the [cdhf-examples](https://github.com/mpobaschnig/cdhf-examples) repository.

## Documentation üñ®Ô∏è

API documentation is available at [https://mpobaschnig.github.io/cdhf/](https://mpobaschnig.github.io/cdhf/).

## 	Visual Exploration & Analysis üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è

In case you would like to visually explore the CERN Mattermost dataset without any programming you can use [Collaboration Spotting X](https://github.com/aleksbobic/csx).

It is a web-based visual network analytics application which includes various convenient features which enable exploration of network datasets on the fly. 

To get started with exploring the CERN Mattermost dataset read the instructions of CSX.
